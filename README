Java project that simulates the PokemonGo application. 
For each test, the data about 2 trainers are read, each of
them having 3 pokemon. A battle takes place one after another 
between the pokemon trainers in the arena. Here they can fight 
with neutral pokemon or against each other. 

The battles between pokemon are done using threads.
 
 In the implementation of the project we used 4 design patterns:
-> Builder for building pokemon, special items and abilities
-> Factory for the construction of neutral pokemon that have similar attributes
-> Singleton to get a single instance of a class, which is a global 
access point for the entire program
-> Observer, for the implementation of the logger that observes an important event 
during the fight and displays it both on stdout and in output files
